# Swap-Characters-Between-Seasons
The tutorial for you to swap characters between seasons for The Definitive Edition.

# Beginning
First, you'll need the materials if you want to make S3 work in S4 for example or S4 in S1. It's limited for now but hopefully in the future there will be more options.

# The Tutorial for Model Swapping

Check this [tutorial](https://othertwdforum.freeforums.net/thread/440/walking-dead-telltale-mods?page=212&scrollTo=82076) for basics, because I'll tell you what files you should change to make your files even better and how to change the characters between the seasons. Believe me it's really simple, you'd be surprised.

# The Files You Should Change
You'll need to rename these parts in each ttarch2 file to make your model swaps look good and awesome!


For example if I want S2 Clem in S3, I gotta be careful while changing names.
S1-S2 files' names are different compared to S3-S4 ones so we have to rename them the same with the character we want to swap with from either S3 or S4.
And this is why I'm leaving a list of files you need to rename. It's the same if you want to import S3 or S4 characters to S1-S2. This list will make it easier for you to find the character files you need to rename.

.d3dmesh **FOR EACH SEASON**| .d3dtx **FOR EACH SEASON**

# **Last Step**

After you are done with renaming, you need to put the materials to Archives folder to make your mod work because if you don't put them your character will either be buggy or invisible.

For example just in case:
I want S2 Clem to be in S3 right? Then I need to put the S1, S2, Michonne, S4 to S3 materials to Archives.
