# Swap-Characters-Between-Seasons
The tutorial for you to swap characters between seasons for The Definitive Edition.

# Beginning
First, you'll need the materials if you want to make S3 work in S4 for example or S4 in S1. It's limited for now but hopefully in the future there will be more options.
[Here are the materials you need to download.](https://www.mediafire.com/file/3f8o608trd84b06/Materials.rar/file)

You'll also need [ttarch](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/ttarchext.zip) to extract the files from ttarch files.
If you have the files then you are good to go for model swapping.
